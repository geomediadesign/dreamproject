## assignment 1 
**Question: How can the new building communicate the identity of Aeres University Almere “let the city breathe"?**

members:
* Germaine, 
* Sharon, 
* Brittany, 
* Daniel, 
* Arne  
* Sil


De identity serves as a binding element for employees and students, this means that first employees and students should identify themselves with this. The identity as it is described right now, is quite verbal. It’d be nice to express this in rituals, symbols, objects and other initiatives that would influence the behaviour of students and employees. This should reflect in the school’s daily routine, like in teaching, having a (lunch)break, attending meetings, working in projects, commuting to school, etc. What behaviour fits within this identity? What are the other events that the school should pay more attention to? What is the role of the citizens in the city of Almere. How does all of this come together in the new building?

## assignment 2
**Question: How can the new building communicate the four SDG’s that Aeres University Almere focuses on?**

members:

* Yasmin, 
* Emma, 
* Joris, 
* Hilke, 
* Lucas and 
* Wessel


The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are the world's best plan to build a better world for people and our planet by 2030. Adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, the SDGs are a call for action by all countries - poor, rich and middle-income - to promote prosperity while protecting the environment. They recognize that ending poverty must go hand-in-hand with strategies that build economic growth and address a range of social needs including education, health, equality and job opportunities, while tackling climate change and working to preserve our ocean and forests. All over the world there are several organizations that have chosen a few of these goals to focus on. Aeres University Almere has chosen these four SDG’s.

When choosing these SDG’s, Aeres University has to commit to it by taking actions in order to help achieve these goals. This means that it’s required to formulate SMART objectives and finding ways to measure the progress on achieving these goals. These objectives and their progress can be communicated visually in the new building. How can this be done in the building or in parts of the building?

## assignment 3
**Question: How can the new building convey that it is a highly sustainable building?**

members:

* Simran, 
* Xanage, 
* Stijn, 
* Carolina, 
* Severin and 
* Sebas

Which stories could be told about the building’s sustainability? Sustainability can be viewed through different dimensions:

Cradle to Cradle: this views seeks to create production techniques that are not just efficient but are essentially waste free. In cradle-to-cradle production, all material inputs and outputs are seen either as technical or biological nutrients. Technical nutrients can be recycled or reused with no loss of quality and biological nutrients composted or consumed. By contrast, cradle-to-grave refers to a company taking responsibility for the disposal of goods it has produced, but not necessarily putting products’ constituent components back into service.

Metabolism of the building: this views concerns the energy consumption, how is the building heated and cooled? How do the users of the building get fresh air? How much energy is consumed by other activities in the building.

The building as a living organism: How does the building make use of natural energy resources like sun and rainwater? What is the function of the plants in the building? In ways which does the building form an ecosystem? What is the relationship between people and the living environment? Are the people (students and staff) ‘strange elements’ in a natural building or do the people and the environment benefit from each other?

## assignment 4
**Question: How can the new building showcase all the study programmes currently offered at Aeres University Almere?**

members:
* Ashwin, 
* Meriem, 
* Damian, 
* Anna, 
* Julia, 
* Krista and 
* Mike


Currently five programmes are being offered:

* Associate degree Sustainable business
* Bachelor Geo Media & Design
* Bachelor European Food Business
* Bachelor Applied Biology
* Bachelor Biology, Food and Health

There are similarities and differences between these programmes. How can you justify each programme’s own characteristics while showcasing is it a whole part of the University? And how can the new building be a place where students from all programmes feel at home in the same building?

## assignment 5
**Question: Each level of the building has its own theme:Earth, Water, People & living environment, Food & air
How can the themes earth and water be communicated?**

members:

* Laura, 
* Levke, 
* Rachel, 
* Sterre, 
* Jakob and 
* Nathan

How can the themes earth and water be communicated?

What are the connecting dots with the current study programmes? What facilities should be offered for these themes?

## assignment 6
**Question: Each level of the building has its own theme:Earth, Water, People & living environment, Food & air
How can the themes earth and water be communicated?**

members:

* Inga, 
* Jan, 
* Corne, 
* Daan, 
* Harry and 
* Remon

How can the themes people and living environment and food & air be communicated?

What are the connecting dots with the current study programmes? What facilities should be offered for these themes?
